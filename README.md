# Doughminators
We did this project for an assignment at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. It is a web application used to improve the process of communication in a pizzeria. It includes a flask server for the backend. An arduino is used for smart oven simulation and for the frontend we have webpages made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
